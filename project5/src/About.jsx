    Hey! I’m Akash, a Junior Frontend Developer with a passion for turning ideas into interactive, user- <br />friendly websites. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m currently expanding my skills with <br /> modern frameworks like React. <br /> <br />

I love building clean, responsive interfaces and learning new tools that help bring designs to life. While I’m <br /> still early in my journey, I’ve already worked on a range of projects—from simple landing pages to full web <br /> apps—and I’m always excited to take on new challenges. <br /> <br />

Right now, I'm looking to grow through real-world experience, collaborate with awesome teams, and keep <br /> leveling up as a developer. <br /> <br />

Let’s connect and build something cool!
